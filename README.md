## Solstice Web Programming Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so the following available scripts are present by default in the project. For the sake of this challenge, only `npm start` and `npm test` should be necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
